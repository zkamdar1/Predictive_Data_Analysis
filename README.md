# College Basketball Predictive Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the predictive analysis project on college basketball conducted by Group 15 for the STOR 320 course. The project aims to answer key questions about predicting win percentages and tournament outcomes based on various basketball metrics.

## Introduction
Being students at UNC, we love UNC basketball and college basketball as a whole. Every year we watch and hope for a successful season from our Tar Heels. From our passion for this team, we discovered some questions that weâ€™d like to answer to get a better understanding of the numbers behind college basketball and how they can be used for predictions.

We explored questions such as:
- Can we predict the win percentage of a college basketball team using key basketball metrics?
- Which specific factors have the greatest impact on win percentage?
- Can we develop a predictive model to forecast a team's chances of making it to the March Madness Tournament and becoming the champion?

## Data
The dataset utilized spans Division I college basketball seasons from 2013 to 2023, excluding the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key variables include offensive and defensive efficiency ratings, shooting percentages, turnover rates, and more.

## Reports
- [Final Paper](reports/Predictive-Analysis-Final-Paper.pdf): Detailed report on our findings and predictive model.
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](reports/Predictive-Analysis-EDA.pdf): Initial analysis of the dataset to understand key trends and metrics.
